# Sample sets and how to open them

## Creating your own set

You can easily create your own sets within the app. Simply choose "+" in the top right corner and then "Add set manually" to enter your set.

For larger sets it might be more convenient to create them on your computer in a spreadsheet application of choice. 
FlashCubes can import CSV files created by spreadsheet applications. See more on that below.

To create your own set of cubes simply enter each cube as a row in the spreadsheet with each of the sides in a separate column.

A set of cubes created in [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) can be downloaded as CSV in `File > Download > Comma-separated values` \

Similarly, a set of cubes created in [Apple Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) can be saved as CSV in `File > Export As > CSV` \

## Getting a CSV file on your device

There are many ways to do it:
- Email or Message it to yourself
- AirDrop it from [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203106) or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144)
- Save it to iCloud and open in iOS [Files app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206481)
- Send it with a [carrier pigeon](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149)

## Importing a CSV file to FlashCubes

Be it in Email, Messages, Safari, or Files, wherever you can view and share ![share icon](/assets/help/share_icon.png) your CSV file you can choose to copy it to FlashCubes. If you don't see the FlashCubes app icon, it can be hiding in the longer list under `More`. \

![Copy to FlashCubes](/assets/help/copy_to_flashcubes.png "Look for this icon!")

If you decide to AirDrop the CSV file a you will have to choose an app to open it. FlashCubes should be on that list. After you use it a couple of times it should even be the first one on the list. \
